This is the backend API for the e-commerce site, written with Flask. The front-end is written in React, and makes calls to this API using the Fetch API. This Flask app then performs operations on a MySQL database. It will then reply with a JSON object as a response.

The configuration is purposefully left out of the repository, as to not reveal sensitive information.
